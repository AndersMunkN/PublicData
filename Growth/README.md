# Growth

The dataset created by `materialize.ibynb` will have one row per country in the world with details about growth from 1970 to 2020 (years can be changed) and a very large set of possible regressors. It is intended to study Barro-style growth regressions. 

The notebook `materialize.ibynb` contains a lot of figures illustrating what is in the dataset as well.
