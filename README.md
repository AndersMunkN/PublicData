# PublicData

This repository will contain code for working with publicly available datasets. The intention is to help students seeking to write an empirical thesis in getting started with empirical work on some good datasets.

## External recommendations

* A [wiki](https://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php) with tons of papers that replicate (and therefore include data), categorized by topic or the methods in use. 
* A [database](https://ejd.econ.mathematik.uni-ulm.de) with "automatic stata reproductions".

## Todo 

A short list of datasets that I eventually want to have code for in this register. 

* [Danish Motor Register](https://github.com/sebastiandyrby/MotorRegisterData): Code written by Sebastian Dyrby when I supervised his master's thesis. The data contains all Danish cars including the odometer (total driving). 
* NBER Industry manufacturing database [NBER](https://www.nber.org/research/data/nber-ces-manufacturing-industry-database): industry-level panel (not firm-level). 
* Spectrum Auctions: Data is e.g. avilable at [Penn](https://capcp.la.psu.edu/data-and-software/fcc-spectrum-auction-data/) or at [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/auctions-summary). 
  * Data for [Denmark](https://ens.dk/en/our-responsibilities/spectrum/auctions)
* Danish pharmaceutical prices at [medicinpriser.dk](https://medicinpriser.dk/).
